Hello!

My name is Aleh Zasypkin, and I am a software engineer with a passion for application security. Today, I am delighted to announce that the beta release of [**Secutils.dev**](https://secutils.dev) is now publicly available!

<!--truncate-->

[**Secutils.dev**](https://secutils.dev) is an [**open-source project**](https://github.com/secutils-dev) that aims to be a go-to place for all the tools you need as an application security engineer, with an easy-to-use and friendly interface. I started this project to organize the code and shell snippets that I have collected over the years, as I often found myself spending a significant amount of time searching for the right tools and resources to support my work.

Although originally intended for personal use, I soon realized that other developers in the same field might find it useful as well. I strongly believe that the number of application security engineers will grow significantly in the coming years, and productivity in this area will become even more important.

Since the project is open-source, anyone can self-host and use it for free, no strings attached. In addition, I decided to explore the feasibility of supporting the sustainable development of such an open-source project by offering a hosted, fully-managed, and plug-and-play SaaS option which can be subscribed to for a reasonable fee. My first goal is to generate enough revenue from subscriptions to pay for hosting and support further development, allowing me to commit to Secutils.dev and open source in general.

The beta is free and meant to facilitate feedback from potential users to help me shape the near-term roadmap, and hence is limited to only three major tools I personally use the most during my day-to-day job: X.509 certificate templates, content security policies (CSP), and HTTP auto-responders. Check out [**video guides**](https://secutils.dev/docs/category/guides) to see what you can do with these tools.

The [**code is open**](https://github.com/secutils-dev), the [**roadmap is public**](/docs/project/roadmap), and I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and findings openly too.

In my next posts, I'm planning to cover [**technological choices I have made**](/blog/2023-05-25-technology-stack-overview.md), [**monitoring**](/blog/2023-05-30-usage-analytics-and-monitoring.md) and [**hosting infrastructure**](/blog/2023-05-28-deployment-overview.md), [**running costs and cost optimizations**](/blog/2023-06-01-running-micro-saas-for-less-than-one-euro-a-month.md), and more.
