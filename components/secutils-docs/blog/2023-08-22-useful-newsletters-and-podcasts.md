Hello!

I'm sharing a quick post today to highlight a few newsletters and podcasts that I find useful. Hopefully, they'll be of use to you too. This post is deliberately brief because I firmly believe that the most effective way to learn something new is to start doing it. Hands-on experience is and always was the master key to personal growth. There's no real shortcut, you can't absorb it all from reading a blog post or tuning into a podcast.

However, that doesn't mean I've sworn off reading, watching, and listening to learn new things or get inspired. I do partake, but I keep it to a bare minimum. In general, I try hard to focus on "creating" over "consuming." Now, let's get to it:

<!--truncate-->

## [**JavaScript Weekly**](https://javascriptweekly.com/) and [**Node Weekly**](https://nodeweekly.com/)

These newsletters are among the best sources to stay up-to-date with the latest happenings in JavaScript, web development, and Node.js. They conveniently categorize content into sections like new releases, articles & tutorials, and code & tools. Since I use JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js extensively, both in my [**day job**](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) and for [**Secutils.dev**](https://github.com/secutils-dev), I have to stay informed about developments in these essential tools. Usually, I quickly scan through the newsletter and focus only on the items that grab my attention â€” it doesn't consume much time but keeps me well-informed.

## [**This Week in Rust**](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)

This newsletter is like JavaScript Weekly but for Rust! It provides updates from the Rust community, highlights updates from the vital Rust projects, shares new ideas and thoughts, offers guides, updates from the Rust core teams, and, sometimes, introduces brand new Rust crates. Rust is my passion and the primary programming language I use for the [**Secutils.dev Server**](https://github.com/secutils-dev/secutils). Every time I read this newsletter, I discover something new and exciting about Rust!

## [**Software Lead Weekly**](https://softwareleadweekly.com/)

This is a curated and condensed newsletter that focuses on people, culture, and leadership in the tech industry. The content selected for this newsletter often resonates with me and even adds a touch of humor. Human beings are complex, and investing in understanding them better always yields significant returns. I hope you too can find valuable insights in this newsletter.

## [**Indie Hackers newsletter**](https://www.indiehackers.com/newsletter) and [**podcast**](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts)

These resources are invaluable for anyone interested in early-stage entrepreneurship. They provide real-life experiences from people worldwide who have ventured to build something, whether successfully or not. This contrasts with the abundance of self-proclaimed experts, thought leaders, and book authors who often lack substantial hands-on experience. Personally, I find greater value in reading about the personal experiences of individuals from various backgrounds who attempted to create small products, even if they didn't succeed, than in consuming the "synthetic" thoughts of bestselling authors (ðŸ‘‹ Simon Sinek & Friends).

## [**Y Combinator YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator)

Whether you're in the process of building a tech product or just contemplating it, I highly recommend exploring this channel, even if you have no intention of applying to YC. The team offers a wealth of valuable insights, founder anecdotes, and startup guidance that can be challenging to come by elsewhere.

## Bonus: [**The idea farm newsletter**](https://theideafarm.com/)

While it's undeniable that "hard", "soft", and entrepreneurial skills are very important for those looking for independence and self-sufficiency, there are other universal skills that shouldn't be overlooked. As I mentioned in my [**"Personal Finances and Indie-Project Budget"**](https://secutils.dev/docs/blog/project-finances) post, I'm a strong advocate for financial literacy and maintaining healthy personal finances. I'm constantly in learning mode in this area, and seeking ways to preserve and invest the money I have.

That's why I really like The Idea Farm newsletter, which provides free access to quite unique investment research and ideas. Many of these align neatly with my personal investment philosophy, making it quite an enjoyable read!

That wraps up today's post, thanks for taking the time to read it!
